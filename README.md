<h3>Project 1: </h3>
  <h5> Data Set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathandumas/liege-microgrid-open-data </h5>
  <h5> In Project 1 the Liege Microgrid Open Dataset is used as input data. This dataset consists of 12 features:
  -date
  -time
  -CD = low clouds (0 to 1)
  -CM = medium clouds (0 to 1)
  -CU = high clouds (0 to 1)
  -PREC = precipitation (mm / 15 min)
  -RH2m = relative humidity (%)
  -SNOW = snow height (mm)
  -ST = Surface Temperature (°C)
  -SWD = Global Horizontal Irradiance (W/m2)
  -SWDtop = Total Solar Irradiance at the top of the     atmosphere (W/m2)
  -TT2M = temperature 2 meters above the ground (°C)
  -WS100m = Wind speed at 100m from the ground (m/s)
  -WS10m =Wind speed at 10m from the ground (m/s)
  -Energy consumption
  -Energy Generation
